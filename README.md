# Prime-Reciprocals
A really simple C code that calculates a mathemathical formula involving primes


![Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\color{White}E_{n+1}=E_n\left(1-\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}\right)+\frac{1}{p_{n+1}})
Where 


I had found a formula involving the reciprocals of primes, tied to the divisors of natural numbers. 
I had conjectured that the infinite sum would be 1, and wrote the code to empirically see it. 

I used dynamic programming to  speed up the computations, which ended up speeding the process by  more than 100 fold.
