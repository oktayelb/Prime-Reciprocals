# Prime-Reciprocals
A really simple C code that calculates a mathemathical formula involving primes


I had found a formula involving the reciprocals of primes, tied to the divisors of natural numbers. 
I had conjectured that the infinite sum would be 1, and wrote the code to empirically see it. 

I used dynamic programming to  speed up the computations, which ended up speeding the process by  more than 100 fold.

I will share the math formula too soonly.
